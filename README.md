# Shop CLI

Personal shopping CLI for the Shop catalog: search millions of stores, find merchant retail locations and nearby pickup inventory, look up products, sign in to your Shop account, build and complete UCP checkouts, and search your orders for tracking, returns, and reorders.

It talks to the Shopify Global Catalog over MCP and to Shop's auth, checkout, and orders APIs. Tokens are stored in your OS secret store via `keytar`.

## Companion to the Shop skill

This CLI is the companion to the **Shop skill**, the agent-facing playbook that drives the end-to-end shopping conversation. The skill calls these commands under the hood and documents every command, flag, and workflow in full.

The skill lives at **https://shop.app/SKILL.md** — see it for the complete reference.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add --global @shopify/shop-cli
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install --global @shopify/shop-cli
```

Requires Node.js >= 20.

## Usage

```bash
shop --help
shop auth status
shop search "trail running shoes" --limit 10
shop locations 21852813 50661914640743 --near-country US --near-city "New York" --max-distance 25 --distance-unit miles
shop catalog lookup gid://shopify/ProductVariant/50362300006715
shop orders search --type recent
```

## Commands

- `shop search` — search the catalog by text, similar items (`--like-id`), or image (`--image`).
- `shop locations <shop-id> <variant-id>` — find BOPIS pickup locations with point-in-time inventory for one exact variant near an explicitly supplied city or postal code (Shop sign-in required for API identity; account location is never used). Inventory is not reserved.
- `shop catalog lookup` / `shop catalog get-product` — look up IDs you already hold and fetch full product detail. `get-product` shows catalog-provided exact-variant checkout links when available.
- `shop auth` — sign in (`login`, or the non-blocking `device-code` + `poll`), check `status`, read the remaining delegated spending `budget`, or `logout`.
- `shop checkout` — `create`, `update`, and `complete` a UCP checkout on the merchant domain (`complete` requires `--confirm`).
- `shop orders search` — search recent orders, tracking, order info, returns, and reorder candidates.
- `shop config` — persist CLI preferences such as a default country.

For BOPIS, first verify nearby exact-variant inventory with `shop locations`, then hand the buyer the exact variant’s catalog-provided checkout link from `shop catalog get-product`. The link does not preselect pickup or a store; the buyer chooses both during normal merchant checkout. If the catalog provides no checkout link, use its product URL instead. Never reconstruct checkout URLs.

Run `shop <command> --help` for the flags on any command, and see the [Shop skill](https://shop.app/SKILL.md) for the full reference and shopping workflow.

## Personal-use limits

This CLI is designed for individual end users, for personal use. The Shopify servers it connects to have usage restrictions. Building commercial services, resale platforms, aggregators, or anything that provides third parties with programmatic access to Shopify's catalog, checkout, delegated payments, or aggregated user data is prohibited.

See https://help.shop.app/en/shop/shopping/personal-agents for accepted and prohibited use.
